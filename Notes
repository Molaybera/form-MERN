-first we run the command "npm init -y".
-also add nodemon so when ever you edit you code and save serve will auto load.
-then install the pacakage {
    express: Web framework for Node.js
    mongoose: MongoDB object modeling tool
    ejs: Template engine for rendering HTML
    body-parser: Middleware to parse form data
} we maybe add more pacakge in futher.
-then created all the nessary files and folders {
  ├── server.js       (main application file)
  ├── views/          (for HTML templates)
  ├── models/         (for database models)
  ├── routes/         (for route definitions)
  └── public/         (for static files like CSS)
}.
-then we have to require the pacakage. in the serve file to use those pacakages.
-then listen the application.
-(optionls you can add "dev": "nodemon server.js" in pacakage.json file to script so when you run the "npm run dev" it will start the app).
